# Now

error handling

maybe save default pictures as base64 already? or some kind of caching of profile pictures

- have the default on the client and not send anything

# Phase 3

- android app
  
  - flutter??? 
  
  - or java probably
  
  - decide based on portability and ad availability

# Phase 4

- legal stuff

- closed beta
